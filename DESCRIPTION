Description: Institutional performance assessment remains a key challenge to a multitude of stakeholders. Existing indicators such as h-type indicators, g-type indicators, and many others do not reflect expertise of institutions that defines their research portfolio. The package offers functionality to compute and visualise two novel indices: the x-index and the xd-index. The x-index evaluates an institution's scholarly expertise within a specific discipline or field, while the xd-index provides a broader assessment of overall scholarly expertise considering an institution's publication pattern and strengths across coarse thematic areas. These indices offer a nuanced understanding of institutional research capabilities, aiding stakeholders in research management and resource allocation decisions.

This package provides the h, g, x, and xd indices for use with standard format of Web of Science (WoS) scrapped datasets.
